# TicTacToe

TicTacToe is a React-based implementation of the classic two-player strategy game. Players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid, aiming to align three of their symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal to win. This project leverages the power of React to deliver a dynamic, responsive, and interactive gaming experience.

## Features

- **Two-Player Gameplay**:
  - Designed for local multiplayer, with players alternating turns.
- **React State Management**:
  - Uses React's state and props to manage game logic, player turns, and board updates.
- **Interactive and Responsive UI**:
  - Clickable grid for placing X or O symbols.
  - Highlights the winning combination dynamically.
- **Restart Button**:
  - Resets the game board while preserving the React component structure.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the UI and managing state.
- **HTML**: To structure the application.
- **CSS**: For styling the game board and ensuring responsiveness.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: For implementing game logic and React components.

## How to Play

1. Run the application in your browser (see installation instructions below).
2. Player 1 uses **X**, and Player 2 uses **O**.
3. Take turns clicking on an empty cell to place your symbol.
4. The game ends when:
   - A player aligns three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, or
   - All cells are filled, resulting in a draw.
5. Click the "Restart" button to clear the board and start a new round.
